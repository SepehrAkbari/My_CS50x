One way is to get the average of loudness or energy, the higher the average the more energetic the listener is.

A better way would perhaps be adding a "catagory" column to the songs table. For example "rock" "pop" etc.
With that we can use SQL to count each catagory within the database, and output the most frequent as the listener's favorite.
