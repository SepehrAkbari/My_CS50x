Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

everything was expected. Except with a larger number of simulations the numbers grew more than expected.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The predictions were not only stabolized but the gaps became more distinct after the third run.
