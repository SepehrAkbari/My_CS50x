# CS50X
#### This repository holds all my work in Harvard's CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (CS50X) course. I completed the course in 2024, and very much recommend it to everyone.
###### Using the exact code available in this repository for CS50X labs and final project goes against Harvard's Academic Honesty code. However, do get inspired from the code. #Loving_OpenSource
